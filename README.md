# PHPWebsite
This website was created as using a PHP backend with HTML, CSS, Javascript front end.

A search platform to find wifi hotspots based on either geolocation, name, suburb or rating. 
Includes a log in system to allow rating and commenting of wifi hotspots
The search queries were done using SQL.

This project was a collaboration with two others. I contributed to aspects of all programming (about 40% of this project).
